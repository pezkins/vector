# Browser Automation

When using browser MCP tools (`cursor-ide-browser` or `cursor-browser-extension`):

## Window Size Constraint

**Before taking any screenshots or snapshots**, resize the browser window to stay under the 2000px model limit:

```
Maximum dimensions: 1600x900 pixels
```

Use `browser_resize` or equivalent to set the viewport before capturing.

## Why

Model providers reject images exceeding 2000px in any dimension. High-DPI displays capture at 2x resolution, so a 1920px window produces a 3840px image.

## Checklist

- [ ] Resize browser to 1600x900 before screenshots
- [ ] Verify window size after navigation (some pages resize)
- [ ] If screenshot fails with "Image Too Large", reduce dimensions further
