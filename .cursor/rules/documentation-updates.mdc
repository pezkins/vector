# Documentation Updates

After completing any significant development work, update the following documentation:

## Required Updates Checklist

### 1. Update `.cursor/PLAN.md`
- [ ] Update "Current Status" section with completed items
- [ ] Move completed tasks from "In Progress" to "Completed"
- [ ] Add any new "Known Issues" discovered
- [ ] Update "Notes for Next Session" if relevant

### 2. Update Skills if Implementation Changed
- [ ] `.cursor/skills/vectorize-project/SKILL.md` - if architecture or build process changed
- [ ] `.cursor/skills/vectorize-live-data/SKILL.md` - if data streaming approach changed
- [ ] Create new skills for major new features

### 3. Update Subagents if Domain Knowledge Changed
- [ ] `.cursor/agents/*.md` - update if APIs, patterns, or processes changed
- [ ] Add new subagents for new specialized domains

### 4. Update README if User-Facing Changes
- [ ] `VECTORIZE_README.md` - update if CLI options, setup, or features changed

## When to Apply

**Always update after:**
- Completing a feature or major task
- Fixing significant bugs
- Changing architecture or APIs
- Adding new components or modules
- Modifying build process

**Skip for:**
- Minor refactoring with no behavior change
- Small bug fixes
- Code style changes

## Example Update

After implementing live data streaming:

```markdown
# In PLAN.md, move from "In Progress" to "Completed":
- [x] **Implement live data streaming**: GraphQL subscriptions working

# In skills/vectorize-live-data/SKILL.md, update:
- Change "needs to be implemented" to "implemented in ui/src/client/subscription.rs"
- Add actual code patterns used

# In agents/data-streaming.md, update:
- Remove implementation checklist (done)
- Add troubleshooting for common issues encountered
```

## Reminder

Before ending a development session, ask yourself:
> "Would a new agent starting tomorrow know what changed and how to continue?"

If not, update the docs.
