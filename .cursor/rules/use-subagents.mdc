# Use Subagents for Specialized Work

When working on tasks that fall within a subagent's specialty, **delegate to that subagent** using the Task tool rather than doing the work directly.

## Available Subagents

| Subagent | Use For |
|----------|---------|
| `build-runner` | Building, compilation errors, dependency issues, starting/stopping Vectorize |
| `data-streaming` | WebSocket connections, GraphQL subscriptions, real-time events, Data Preview panel |
| `ui-builder` | Leptos components, signals, UI styling, drag-and-drop, TailwindCSS |
| `vector-expert` | Vector GraphQL API, TOML config, component types, pipeline topology |

## When to Delegate

**Always use the appropriate subagent when:**
- Starting builds or fixing build errors → `build-runner`
- Working on WebSocket/subscription code → `data-streaming`
- Creating or modifying UI components → `ui-builder`
- Working with Vector's API or config format → `vector-expert`

**Do NOT delegate for:**
- Simple file reads or searches
- Quick config changes
- Documentation updates

## How to Invoke

Use the Task tool with the `subagent_type` parameter:

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "build-runner"
  prompt: "Build the UI and CLI, then start Vectorize with config/demo.toml"
```

## Parallel Subagents

When tasks are independent, invoke multiple subagents in parallel:
- Building UI + Building CLI → two parallel `build-runner` tasks
- UI changes + API changes → `ui-builder` + `vector-expert` in parallel

## Benefits

- Subagents have specialized context and knowledge
- Faster task completion with focused expertise
- Consistent patterns across the codebase
